### Testing jekyll 
<p>

When you treat content as code, you get the opportunity to co-opt best-of-breed developer workflows, and continuous integration is no exception. We’ve all been there. You make a simple change and end up breaking two or three other things. Links get out of date. Images move. Imagine if every time you made a change, all those things that you consciously or subconsciously worry about were automatically checked. Are my links accurate? Did any of my images break? Does this darn thing actually render the way I want it to? </p>

<p>

With CI services like Travis CI, whether public or private, adding continuous integration to a repository of prose content, whether an entire website or a collection of HTML or Markdown files becomes trivial, especially when you use open source tools like HTML Proofer.

Continuous integration (CI) is the idea that for every change, whether proposed or realized, a standard battery of tests run, to confirm the change does what you intend it to do. In most developer tools, like GitHub, you get instant feedback, in the form of a green light, to let you know that that is in fact the case, or a red light, in the event that something went awry, detailing exactly what doesn’t match you specified expectations. </p>
