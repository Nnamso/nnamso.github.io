I’m sick of people buying things they don’t want just to impress the people they don’t like.

And I’m tired of the media pushing these ugly African models

Trying to convince me they exotic when they just plain ugly

There’s not only one type of black beauty.

I’m sick of people sitting down complaining that there is no job.

I’m tired of girls thinking that being attractive is an occupation.

I’m sick of Ghanaians still hating on Nigerians when we are suppose to be united.

I’m sick of ladies having fake ass, fake breast, fake looks, and fake accent just to impress me.

And I want to smack people who don’t even realize Nigeria is a country and Africa is a continent.

I’m sick and tired of power outbreak in Nigeria.

I’m sick of police saying that bail is free, when I just paid 50,000 Naira in exchanged for his release and I was given no receipt.

And I’m sick of people bragging about the ghetto
the ghetto’s a situation we supposed to be getting out of not embracing.

And I’m sick of everybody trying to be in the entertainment industry
because soon, there’ll be no audience just a bunch of monkeys on stage dancing.

I’m still sick; I think I need panadol, what are your sick of?
