I LOVE THE WORD: Connecting the Dot. 

I have been connecting the dot for a while now. 

I am building an empire. In the interest of helping people who might otherwise be inclined to believe that Stuff Just Happens, I thought I’d share my plan with you.

Now, before I am rich and famous, so when people accuse me of being disingenuous when I say I make my own luck, I can say “hey" didn’t you read my blog?”My plan is a twist on this simple and well-known classic:

Watch Youtube.
???
Profit!
Maybe play video games…
OK, My real goal is to:

[1]	Make kickass software and change the world for the better. And make the world a better place.

[2]	Inspire & help a thousand designers/developers to launch their own products

[3]	Make alot of money

[4]	Yes, I want to be rich, famous, and influential. is that all? Well, I think so. Wouldn’t want to be greedy, now!

Plan or do not plan, there is no luck

If you take yourself seriously, you have to plan. If you don’t take yourself seriously, you don’t have to plan — and, as we all know, a failure to plan, is a plan to fail.

Planning is a love letter to your future. 

I take myself seriously. And I loooooove my future and want it to feel that special love through time! So I plan.
