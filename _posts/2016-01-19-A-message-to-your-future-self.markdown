**A message to your future self** – Ever go back and look at old code, only to scratch your head[^2] as to what's going on? The same you that may be asking yourself what you were thinking when you got a tattoo five years back, is also going to be asking why you wrote that singleton function five years ago. Yet when you write open source, you mitigate that risk by explaining your code in such a way that others (including your future self) can understand it. In a world of system orientated architectures and ever-changing requirements, the chance that a software project is one-and-done is increasingly rare, not to mention the fact that by failing to properly document, you're introducing a significant risk of vendor lock in. Your successor will thank you, and so will the person paying the bills.

The reality of today's business environment is that all software is inherently "open source", even if the scope of the sharing is limited to an organization. Assume the software is open, needs to be modular, and will be repurposed, and you will save significant costs in the long run. And when you require the same of outside contractors, you get better, more flexible code, and offset the risks of vendor or technology lock in in the long run.

Justice Brandeis is famous for noting that "sunlight is the best disinfectant." Likewise, the transparency afforded by the open-source ethos produces more reliable software[^3] –  so why not simply assume your code is going to be open source from the start?

[^1]: The same would apply when you're buying software and the contractor is under the impression no one outside the organization will ever see the code, and more importantly, the code could never negatively impact the public's perception of their overall work-product
