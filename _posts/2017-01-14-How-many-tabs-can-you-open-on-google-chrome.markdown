My little nephew asked me this question today

Allen: Uncle how many tabs can you open in your browser?

The reality is that it depends on the type of hardware you use.
I'm not a fan of bookmarks. I basically open so much stuff that I end up not reading them.

That's what happens when cool kinds of stuff keep popping up whenever you are hooked with fast internet.

The bigger the screen the more you are likely to open the more tabs.

I have no issues. I have noticed that Chrome uses lots of RAM when a large number of tabs are open. I suspect that this is the key to being able to keep this many open. In firefox, all of the tabs run in 1 processor thread. This causes it to be subject to the 32 bit RAM usage limit. Chrome, instead, creates a new process for each tab or tab group, allowing it to use as much ram as it needs.

This brings me back to my second point. Chrome can use as much as it needs, as long as you have enough ram. My computer has 8GB of ram, so I have no problem with 40+ tabs. In firefox, I get to 20 before it locks up.

Finally, my first point: Depending on your screen size at 50 tabs upward, I can no longer see the favicons that help me distinguish tabs apart.

Chrome should handle as many tabs as you need. If you have more ram than me and would like to test, let me know how many you get running.
